# Flutter Instagram Clone with Firebase

I've created an Instagram clone using the Flutter framework, integrated with Firebase. The app has the following features:

> Users can sign up and log in from anywhere, as it is connected to an online database (Firebase).
> Users can upload posts.
> Users can like posts.
> Users can comment on posts.
> Users can view others' profiles.
> Users can follow each other.
> Users can search for others' profiles.
> Users can delete their own posts.

The best part is that, since the app is connected to Firebase, all users are connected regardless of their location in the world.
PS. Sorry, touch taps were disabled, so it might be difficult to figure out whereÂ I'mÂ tappingÂ ğŸ™„
